Is it better to have a key thats just board state, or instead something that encapsulates all game state. 
Things we need to store:
- board
- whose turn it is
- current turn/stage
- list of spectators - just general people in the room, list of session ids so we can send updates. No limit to growth
- list of players - {sessionId, color, piecesCount}. Limited to 4. 
- current dice roll
- score (unless this can be determined quickly by the board, which would be nice)
- game state: in-progress, need-players, complete


room:<room-id> - hash
    board (json, number[][])
    active-player: number
    turn: number
    dice: string
    game-state: string

players:<room-id> - list
    name
    sessionId
    color

spectators:<room-id> - set
    sessionId
